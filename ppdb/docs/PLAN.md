# PPDB Development Plan

## Guidelines for AI Engineers
> These are critical guidelines that must be followed for every change

### Pre-modification Checklist
- [ ] **File Content Check**
  - Always check complete content of target files before modification
  - Understand the file's purpose and structure
  - Review recent changes and their rationale

- [ ] **Dependency Analysis**
  - Check related header files for existing definitions
  - Verify include hierarchy and dependencies
  - Avoid duplicate definitions between ppdb.h and internal.h
  - Remember we're using Cosmopolitan libc - don't include standard libc headers

- [ ] **Architecture Principles**
  - Maintain clear separation between public and internal APIs
  - Follow existing patterns and naming conventions
  - Consider impact on other components
  - Think about future extensibility

- [ ] **Cross-platform Considerations**
  - Remember we use Cosmopolitan for cross-platform support
  - Don't add platform-specific adaptations unnecessarily
  - Don't include Windows-specific headers or libc headers
  - Use Cosmopolitan's provided functionality

### Development Standards
- [ ] **Code Quality**
  - Follow C11 standard
  - Maintain consistent style
  - Write clear comments
  - Include error handling

- [ ] **Testing**
  - Write tests first
  - Cover edge cases
  - Include benchmarks
  - Test failure modes

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - Document as you code
  - Include examples
  - Explain design choices
  - Keep docs updated

- [ ] **Performance**
  - Profile regularly
  - Set benchmarks
  - Optimize carefully
  - Document tradeoffs
